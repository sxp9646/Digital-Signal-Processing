On revision 10042 the files server.cc, listencanfork.c and stringmatch.c were
removed from the src/ directory of the miscellaneous package since no one on the
mailing list knew what to do with these files. The packages releases were also
not properly configured to handle it's code and even Debian packages of
miscellaneous do not include them.

Looking at the code of server.cc, it seems to implement the functions server,
listen and senderror. Some of these would conflict with the functions in the
package sockets. Maybe this code should be merged with sockets.
